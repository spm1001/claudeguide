# Claude Setup Notes

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

**New to Terminal?** Don't worry! Follow these steps in order, and we'll guide you through each decision.

### Step 1: Open Terminal

1. Press **Cmd+Space** to open Spotlight search
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter
3. A black or white window will open - this is your Terminal

**Terminal Basics:**

- **Copy text:** Highlight text, then **Cmd+C**
- **Paste text:** **Cmd+V** (if this doesn't work, try right-clicking and selecting "Paste")
- **Run a command:** Type it and press **Enter**

### Step 2: Switch to zsh (Required)

Modern macOS uses zsh as the default shell. We'll ensure you're using it:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

**What happens:** You might be asked for your Mac password (the one you use to log in).

**Next:** Close Terminal completely (Cmd+Q) and reopen it.

### Step 3: Install Apple Command Line Tools

These tools include git and other essentials that Claude Code needs:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**What will happen:**

1. A popup window will appear asking to install developer tools
2. Click "Install" and wait 5-10 minutes for download
3. You'll see a confirmation when it's complete

### Step 4: Install Claude Code

**What is Claude Code?** It's the command-line tool that lets you interact with Claude AI from Terminal.

#### 4a. Install Claude Code

Copy and paste this command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**What will happen:**

- Claude Code will download and install
- The installer will guide you through connecting your Anthropic account
- No password required for this step

**Don't have a Claude account yet?** Create one at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) first.

#### 4b. Verify Claude Code installation

Close and reopen Terminal, then run:

```bash
claude --version
```

**Expected result:** You should see a version number like "claude 0.x.x"

**If you see "command not found":**

1. Add Claude to your PATH permanently:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Restart Terminal completely (Cmd+Q then reopen)
3. Try `claude --version` again

### Step 5: Final Verification

**Everything installed correctly?** Run this final check:

```bash
echo "macOS: $(sw_vers -productVersion)"
echo "Shell: $SHELL"
git --version
claude --version
```

**What you should see:**
- Your macOS version 
- Shell: /bin/zsh
- Git version number
- Claude version number

**Final test:**
```bash
claude --help
```

If this shows Claude's help menu, you're all set! ðŸŽ‰

**If any of these commands fail:** Check the troubleshooting section below.

## Optional: Install Homebrew (Package Manager)

**Skip this section if you just want to use Claude Code.** Homebrew is useful if you plan to install other development tools later.

**What is Homebrew?** A package manager that makes installing developer tools easier.

### Install Homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**What will happen:**

1. You'll be asked for your Mac password
2. Press **Enter** when it asks "Press RETURN to continue"
3. Wait 5-15 minutes for installation

### Add Homebrew to your PATH

Check your Mac type:

```bash
uname -m
```

**If "arm64"** (Apple Silicon):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

**If "x86_64"** (Intel Mac):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### Test Homebrew

```bash
brew --version
```

You should see something like "Homebrew 4.x.x".

## Claude Code Tips & Features

Now that Claude Code is installed, here are some useful features and CLI basics that aren't immediately obvious:

### Pasting Images
You can paste images directly from your clipboard into Claude Code prompts:
1. Copy an image to your clipboard (Cmd+C from any app, or **Cmd+Shift+Ctrl+4** for screenshot to clipboard)
2. In the Claude Code prompt, just paste with **Ctrl+V** (note: Ctrl, not Cmd in the prompt)
3. Claude can analyze screenshots, diagrams, code snippets, etc.

### CLI Navigation Basics
If you're new to command-line interfaces, these keyboard shortcuts are essential:

**Text Navigation:**
- **Arrow keys** - Move cursor left/right, up/down through command history
- **Cmd+A** - Select all text in current line
- **Cmd+Left/Right** - Jump to beginning/end of line
- **Option+Left/Right** - Jump word by word

**Important Differences from Regular Apps:**
- **Can't click to move cursor** - Use arrow keys instead
- **Ctrl+C** - Cancels/interrupts the current command (doesn't copy text!)
- **Copy/Paste varies by context:**
  - Terminal commands: **Cmd+C/V**  
  - Claude Code prompts: **Ctrl+C/V**

### Interactive Mode Features
When you run `claude` without arguments, you enter interactive mode:

**Multi-line Input:**
- Type your question normally
- Press **Enter** to send the message
- For multi-line prompts, use **Shift+Enter** for new lines without sending

**Command History:**
- **Up/Down arrows** - Browse through your previous prompts
- Great for tweaking and re-running similar requests

**File References:**
- Type `@` to see a searchable list of files in your project tree
- **Navigate the list:** Use arrow keys to highlight files (purple highlight shows selection)
- **Search/Filter:** Keep typing after `@` to find files anywhere in the tree (e.g., `@fig` finds all files containing "fig")
- **Select file:** Press **Enter** to select the highlighted file
- **Cancel:** Press **Escape twice** to close the chooser
- Claude will read and include the selected file content in the conversation
- **Tip:** The search looks through the entire project tree below your current directory

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Start interactive session
claude

# Run a single command
claude "What's in this directory?"

# Get help
claude --help

# Check version
claude --version
```
