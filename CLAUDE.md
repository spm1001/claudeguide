## Target User Profile

This documentation is specifically designed for **absolute beginners** who are:
- **New to Terminal/command line** - May have never used Terminal before
- **New to development workflows** - Haven't used git, GitHub, or development tools
- **Intimidated by technical setup** - Need hand-holding through each step
- **Prone to copy/paste errors** - Need warnings about multi-line commands and spacing
- **Using macOS** - Guide leverages macOS-specific features and stable folder structure
- **Want to use Claude Code** - Primary goal is getting Claude Code working as their AI assistant

## Documentation Strategy

The guide uses several key strategies to serve beginners:
1. **Educational approach** - Explains what commands do and why they're needed
2. **Error prevention** - Proactive warnings about common mistakes (copy/paste, spaces in paths)
3. **Alternative methods** - Provides both manual commands and "ask Claude to help" approaches
4. **Visual cues** - Uses Terminal symbols and keyboard shortcuts prominently
5. **Tab completion emphasis** - Reduces typing errors and path complexity
6. **Incremental complexity** - Builds from basic Terminal use to full git/GitHub workflows
