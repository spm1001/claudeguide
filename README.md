# Claude Code Guide for non Terminal users on MacOS

So this is a short guide to how to work with Claude Code on a Mac, designed for peopel with limited or no Terminal experience. 

The amusing thing about it is that it was mostly developed with help from, er, Claude Code. 

I'm open to pull requests if anyone has any useful builds.
